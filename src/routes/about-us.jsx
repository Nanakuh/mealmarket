        Our Story
      </h3>

      <p>
        Recetas de Anita™ was born from a simple idea: to bring the best food
        directly to your door. Founded in 2024 by Anita, a food enthusiast, our
        company has grown thanks to the trust and support of our amazing
        customers. What started as a small family business quickly became the
        go-to choice for those seeking convenience without sacrificing flavor.
